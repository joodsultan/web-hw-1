            Netflix has been marked for its many great dramas, especially those based on true stories. And Manhunt: Unabomber is no exception. There are many who may still remember hearing about the real-life events that are covered in this drama miniseries. It recounts the events of the Unabomber case, which caused a huge uproar during the late 80’s and early 90’s.

            The storytelling in this crime-drama is unique, as the perpetrator is revealed from the very beginning. The audience doesn’t have to wait anxiously until the end to discover his identity. The focus is heavily on the childhood and life-long story of the Unabomber. This is one of the few investigative shows where you end up empathizing with a serial killer.
            
            Sam Worthington, Paul Bettany, and Chris Noth are some of the actors that do a great job bringing to life one of most the horrific events in American crime history. In eight episodes of tension and analysis,  you get a real look inside the killer’s psychological state.
